/**
 * 
Given the reference to the root of a binary tree and a value k, 
return the number of paths in the tree such that the sum of the nodes along the path equals k.
Note: The path does not need to start at the root of the tree, but must move downward.

Ex: Given the following binary tree and value k…

      3
     / \
    1   8
k = 11, return 1 (3 -> 8).
Ex: Given the following binary tree and value k…

      2
     / \
   -4   9
   /
  2
k = 2, return 3 (2, 2 -> -4, -4 -> 2).
